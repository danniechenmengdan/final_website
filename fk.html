                    The properties of all things in time are set,
                    each thing has its own properties, and the world operates under such rules. A shape is the sum of an
                    object or its outer boundaries, Outlines, and surfaces
                   <br><br> Other properties of the object (e.g. color, texture, material composition, etc.) are irrelevant.
                    Shape is in the properties I recognize
                    Most importantly, people can judge a person by their shape, they can judge an object by its
                    silhouette. So shape is the biggest determinant in the recognition system. <br><br>When we break the shape
                    of an object, it is the shape of an object that transforms, fuses, transforms, what new species does
                    it become.
